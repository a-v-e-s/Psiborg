#! first make sure muse is connected via bluetooth, and arduino connected via USB

=========================================================================================================================================

# commands to enter to begin streaming, recording, and viewing muse data:
#
$ sudo chown crowbar:crowbar /dev/ttyACM0
#
$ python3 -m muselsl stream
# then wait for it to connect and stream...
#
# make sure we have a good connection:
$ python3 -m muselsl view -b Qt5Agg
# -b Qt5Agg option necessary to change the backend on blacktop; may not be necessary on other machines.
#
# then once the graphs have stabilized, in EEGs repo:
$ python3 -m muselsl record -d 1800 # or whatever number of seconds you want to record for
#
# then start the game!
$ python3 master.py

==========================================================================================================================================

Need a gui for examining eeg data with graphs

Need to figure out the math of what's going on and why delta is always > theta > alpha > beta > gamma,
as though i was always asleep while recording.
Is it the math or is it the muse that is crappy?
