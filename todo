heartrate {
    {fix hr data gathering because more than half of the time it is crap.};

    {jupyter notebook for examining hr data;
        cut data up into chunks, make image for each, string the images together};
};

Implement GSR;
Try to get GSR and HR data to both be gathered by the same arduino.

{fix your sqlite database and data structure in general.
    create a new db if you need to.};
